# nip

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sirflankalot/nip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sirflankalot/nip)

A work in progress compiler for the programming language Kitten made by [Jon Purdy](https://github.com/evincarofautumn). More information can be found on the language's website [kittenlang.org](http://kittenlang.org/).

### Build

With nip being written in modern C++14, a modern compiler is needed. Currently, ```g++-4.9``` and ```clang++-3.5``` are the earliest that nip compiles with. This may INCREASE, as a few C++17 features may start to be integrated.
